# People

We are a cross-disciplinary group of researchers, students, and collaborators interested in understanding the computational principles of intelligence and using that to build AI systems that can think, explain, and adapt. Our lab values intellectual clarity, experimental rigor, and an openness to rethinking core assumptions. We welcome individuals from diverse academic and personal backgrounds who share a curiosity about the structure of thought and the future of machine intelligence.
