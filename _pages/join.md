## Interested in working with us?

We are always looking for curious, motivated students—both undergraduate and graduate—who are excited by our work and want to contribute meaningfully to it.

But before you reach out, **we ask that you do some thinking first.**

Joining a research lab should not be a cold email and a résumé. It should start with **an idea**, **a connection**, and **a bit of effort**. Below are the steps we’d like you to take before contacting us. This helps ensure we’re a good fit for each other, and filters for students who take initiative and think deeply.

---

## Step 1: Read at least **two** papers from our lab

Take your time with this. You don’t need to understand every technical detail. But you should be able to explain:

- **What question is this paper trying to answer?**  
- **What do you find interesting, strange, or exciting about it?**  
- **Can you relate it to another idea you’ve encountered—in class, research, or elsewhere?**

You can find a few selected publications [here](/research) and a more complete list [here](/publications)

## Step 2: Answer the following short prompts

When you email us, **include answers to the following**:

1. What are your academic interests? What areas of AI (or cognitive science, philosophy, etc.) excite you most?  
2. Which **two papers** from our lab did you read, and why did they interest you?  
3. What’s one question you had while reading, and how would you begin to explore it?
4. Tell us about a project or experience you’ve had (coursework, independent work, creative hobby, etc.) that reflects your mindset or approach to problem-solving.

## Step 3: The fun part

Just to make sure you made it this far:  
Please also tell us **your favorite metaphor for intelligence** (real or made up), and why you like it.

Past examples from students include:  
> “Intelligence is like a tuning fork in a chaotic room—seeking resonance amidst noise.”  
> “A library that rearranges its own shelving system based on what questions people ask.”

We like students who think both structurally and playfully.

## Logistics & Expectations

We work with both undergraduate and graduate students. Here’s what you should know:

- **Undergraduates** typically start as research assistants for credit, then move into paid roles as they take on more responsibility. We often mentor independent projects and senior theses.
- **Graduate students** interested in advising or co-advising should indicate how their thesis goals align with our lab’s research themes.
- We expect intellectual initiative, clarity of writing and thought, and the ability to manage ambiguity and iterate quickly.

We have regular lab meetings, a collaborative writing culture, and an emphasis on sharing unfinished ideas.

We can’t respond to every message, but we do read all thoughtful inquiries.
