description: I believe machines must become vastly better at analogical reasoning before they reach human-level intelligence, and I enjoy using neurally-plausible vector-symbolic mathematics to work on this difficult problem. In my free time, I enjoy chess, reading (especially cognitive science textbooks!), writing, running, and spending time with friends and family.
